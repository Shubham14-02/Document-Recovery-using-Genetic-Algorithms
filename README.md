#Problem Description
Files given are scrambled/shredded and look like this:

The actual document is a paragraph containing important information. And looks like this:

#Goal
Develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reconstruct the original documents from the shredded fragments

# What a solution/chromosome looks like

# What GA does
Using concepts of evolution, it takes _**n**_ chromosomes and evolves them over given number of generations using mating and mutation. So for instance, 100 individual are in a pool, 2 are selected and mated to produce 2 individuals for the next generation
